# LRML Search

## Overview

LRML Search is a web application for storing, viewing and searching LegalRuleML documents, developed as part of the LegalRuleMLParl project. Under the hood, it is a PHP 7.0 Laravel web app which uses BaseX for XML storage and querying, and PostgreSQL for all other data storage.

## User's guide

Documentation in Markdown format [can be found in `src/resources/help/usersguide.md`](src/resources/help/usersguide.md), and also within the app itself.

## Maintenance notes

This is a Laravel application. Therefore, its best practice should be adhered to in maintenance, e.g. database changes should have their own migrations.

If you are modifying `LRMLToHTMLConverter`, bear in mind that in production, it is only run once for each document at the point of upload, and then the HTML version is cached in the PostgreSQL database. Therefore, changes made to the converter will only affect existing documents if they are reuploaded. By contrast, in debug mode it is run every time a document is viewed, allowing for rapid iteration.

## Getting started

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


```sh
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run web bash -c 'php artisan migrate && php artisan db:seed --class=UsersTableSeeder'
```

#### User account

By default (see `src/database/seeds/UsersTableSeeder.php`), a user account with the email address `user@localhost` and the password `lrmlsearch` is created. With this account, you can log in and upload or delete documents, as well as create other user accounts.

For security reasons it is not a good idea to keep this initial account around; delete it or change its password. (Unfortunately, neither can be done directly through the interface right now.)
